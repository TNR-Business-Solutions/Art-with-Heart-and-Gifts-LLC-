# 🔍 Finding Your Railway Backend URL

## 📍 **You're Currently In: Project Settings**

I can see you're in the **Project Settings** page. To find your backend URL:

## 🎯 **STEP 1: Go to Deployments Tab**

1. **Look at the left sidebar** in Railway
2. **Click on "Deployments"** (not Settings)
3. **Click on the latest deployment** (should show "Deployed" status)
4. **Look for the URL** in the deployment details

## 🎯 **ALTERNATIVE: Go to Main Dashboard**

1. **Click on your project name** at the top: "Art with heart and gifts llc"
2. **This should take you to the main project dashboard**
3. **Look for a URL** displayed prominently on the page
4. **Should be something like:** https://your-app.up.railway.app

## 🎯 **ALTERNATIVE: Check Domains Tab**

1. **In the left sidebar, click "Domains"**
2. **Look for generated domains**
3. **Copy the Railway-generated URL**

## 📋 **What to Look For:**

Your Railway URL will look like one of these:
- `https://backend-production-1234.up.railway.app`
- `https://art-with-heart-and-gifts-llc-production.up.railway.app`
- `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`

## 🧪 **Once You Have the URL:**

Test it by visiting:
- `https://your-url.up.railway.app/api/health`
- Should return: `{"status":"OK"}`

## 🚨 **If You Can't Find the URL:**

1. **Check the Railway logs** for any deployment errors
2. **Verify the deployment completed successfully**
3. **Make sure environment variables are set**
