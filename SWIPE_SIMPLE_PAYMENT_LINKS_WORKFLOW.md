# ðŸ’³ Swipe Simple Payment Links Workflow

## âœ… **ISSUE RESOLVED: Payment Redirect Fixed**

The checkout button was redirecting to a non-existent `/pay` endpoint. I've updated the system to use Swipe Simple's **Payment Links** feature properly.

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEW PAYMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Customer Experience:**

1. âœ… Customer adds items to cart
2. âœ… Customer clicks "Continue to Checkout"
3. âœ… **NEW**: System shows order confirmation with payment instructions
4. âœ… Customer receives clear instructions on how to complete payment
5. âœ… You create a payment link in Swipe Simple dashboard
6. âœ… Customer receives payment link via email
7. âœ… Customer clicks link to complete payment on Swipe Simple

### **Your Process (Business Owner):**

1. **Customer places order** â†’ You receive order notification
2. **Create Payment Link** in Swipe Simple dashboard:
   - Go to **Payment Links** in your Swipe Simple dashboard

3. **Send Payment Link** to customer via email
4. **Customer pays** â†’ You receive notification
