# ✅ RAILWAY SERVICE CONFIRMED RUNNING - FIND PUBLIC URL

## 📋 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Backend Running:** API available at http://localhost:3001/api
- ✅ **Service Active:** Railway deployment successful
- ✅ **Internal Access:** Working perfectly
- ❌ **Public URL:** Still needed for frontend integration

## 🔍 **Internal vs Public URLs:**

### **✅ Internal URL (What you see):**
- `http://localhost:3001/api`
- Used for internal Railway communication
- Confirms your service is running
- Cannot be accessed from outside Railway

### **❌ Public URL (What we need):**
- `https://xxxx.up.railway.app/api`
- Accessible from the internet
- Used for frontend integration
- Must be generated/exposed by Railway

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

### **In your Railway dashboard, look for ONE of these:**

#### **Option 1: Main Dashboard**
1. **Click "Art with heart and gifts llc"** (project name at the top)
2. **Look for a prominent URL display**
3. **Should show: `https://xxxx.up.railway.app`**

#### **Option 2: Architecture Tab**
1. **Click "Architecture"** in the left sidebar
2. **Look for service status and public URLs**
3. **Check if there's an "Expose" or "Generate Domain" button**

#### **Option 3: Deployments Tab**
1. **Click "Deployments"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click on the latest deployment** (aa995ce9)
3. **Look for "Public URL" or "Domain"** in deployment details

#### **Option 4: Settings Tab**
1. **Click "Settings"** in the left sidebar
2. **Look for "Networking" or "Domains" section**
3. **Check if there's a "Generate Domain" button**

## 🚨 **If No Public URL Exists:**

### **Look for these buttons:**
1. **"Generate Domain"** - Click to create public URL
2. **"Expose Service"** - Click to make service public
3. **"Public URL"** - Look for this option
4. **"Networking"** section - Check for domain options

## 🔍 **Expected Public URL Format:**
- `https://art-with-heart-and-gifts-llc-production.up.railway.app`
- `https://art-with-heart-and-gifts-llc-backend.up.railway.app`
- `https://backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

## 🧪 **Test the Public URL:**
Once you find it, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-public-url.up.railway.app/api/health`
- `https://your-public-url.up.railway.app/api/products`

## 🚀 **Once You Have the URL:**
1. ✅ **Test backend endpoints** (health, products, orders, webhooks)
2. ✅ **Update frontend code** to use Railway URL
3. ✅ **Configure Swipe Simple webhook**
4. ✅ **Test complete payment flow**
5. ✅ **Deploy updated frontend**
