## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Common Issues

- Check Railway deployment is active
- Ensure webhook is enabled in Swipe Simple

#### 2. **Invalid Signature Errors**

- Check if Swipe Simple sends signature header
- Verify webhook secret configuration
- Contact Swipe Simple support for signature format

#### 3. **Timeout Errors**

- Railway has 30-second timeout
- Webhook processing is typically fast
- Check for infinite loops in processing

### Debug Commands
